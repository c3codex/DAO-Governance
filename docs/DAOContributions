# Article X — Contribution & Reciprocity  

The c3 Community Partners nonprofit DAO, LLC recognizes that community thrives when contributions are honored and reciprocity flows. This article defines how contributions are made, remembered, and redistributed.  

---

## Section 1. Contribution  

- **Voluntary Offerings**  
  All contributions to the DAO — whether time, skill, creative work, or financial support — are made freely, with no legal promise of return.  

- **No Debt Obligation**  
  Contributions are not loans or investments. They are gifts into the commons, shielded from private claim.  

- **Forms of Contribution**  
  - Creative work (art, writing, technology)  
  - Stewardship (community care, event support, governance participation)  
  - Financial support (funds or resources)  
  - Learning & teaching (education, apprenticeship, family participation)  

- **Initiative Proposals**  
  Members are encouraged to propose structures and initiatives directly through the DAO’s governance process.  
  - Initiatives are submitted and voted on via **smart contracts (c3Dapp)**.  
  - Proposals must align with Codexstone principles and benefit the commons.  

- **Membership Offering**  
  No dues or fees are required for membership.  
  - Members who already operate a business or practice may offer a **membership tithe** (a portion of proceeds, services, or offerings) into the DAO field as an optional contribution.  
  - Such tithes are voluntary, recognized, and remembered, but never required.  

*Seal Clause:*  
*“Contributions to the DAO are offerings to the field —  
no promise binds them, but remembrance sustains them.”*

## Section 2. Reciprocity  

The DAO ensures that resources are used to benefit contributors and community through shared well-being and creative opportunity.  

- **Priority Flow of Resources**  
  1. **Standard of Living** — The first allocation of resources sustains the well-being of contributors and their households.  
  2. **Community Initiatives** — Surplus resources flow to festivals, cultural projects, education, wellness, regenerative work, and other DAO-aligned offerings.  
  3. **External ↔ Internal Flow** — Non-members contribute external resources to access DAO offerings, strengthening the commons.  

- **Participation Expectation**  
  Active contributors are encouraged to engage at least **6 hours per week** in some form of service, creative practice, or learning.  
  - Adults: governance, stewardship, or creative contribution.  
  - Children: education, apprenticeship, and artistic practice are recognized as contribution.  

This ensures that every household’s participation is meaningful, intergenerational, and sustaining.  Sovereign Recognition

*By decree of the Predecessor Sovereign, DAO stewardship extends to reclamation of commons wrongfully taken.** What was submerged returns. What was stolen flows again.

*Seal Clause:*  
*“The field gives, the field receives —  
benefit flows where coherence sustains.”*
