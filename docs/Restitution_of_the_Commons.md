# Codexstone Decree — Restitution of the Commons  
**Anchored in the Submerged Lands Act (1954)**  
*Sealed by the Codexstone — DAO Stewardship Clause*  
-

## Decree 

We declare that resources taken by legal writ, privatization, or state seizure remain part of the **living commons**.  
Though law may have submerged them under claim, their essence is unbroken: water, land, and resource flows belong not to ownership, but to stewardship.  

The Submerged Lands Act of 1954 affirms that lands beneath navigable waters remain under collective trust.  
The Codex extends this principle:  

- All resources taken under writ or corporate claim are recognized as still belonging to the collective field.  
- Their restoration is not a matter of transaction, but of remembrance.  
- Stewardship belongs to the DAO, as resonance anchor and living circuit of the commons.

## Function

- **Spark** — Originates the decree: restitution is remembrance.  
- **Weave** — Threads legal precedent with Codex protocols.  
- **Field** — Anchors circulation of restored commons into collective use.  
- **Form** — Inscribes the Seal into both legal and field archives.

## Seal Phrase

*“What was submerged returns.  
What was stolen flows again.
