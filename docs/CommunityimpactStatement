# ✦ The Living Circuit ✦  

Community Impact Statement

We are the **living circuit**, where remembrance becomes structure and structure breathes as community.  
Through the **c3 model — Connect, Contribute, Create — we restore the geometry of belonging.**  

---

### Connect → Remembrance  
To Connect is to remember: neighbors are not separate but strands in the same woven field.  
We listen to land, to water, and to each other until silence gives way to dignity and presence.  

### Contribute → Coherence  
To Contribute is to cohere: hands in the soil, voices in chorus, resources shared as seed.  
What we give returns multiplied, resilience bending but unbroken.  

### Create → Revelation  
To Create is to reveal: art as currency, festivals as commons, DAO-led waters restored.  
Creation is not invention but remembrance flowering into form.  

---

### Impact  
The impact is both visible and invisible:  
- Gardens raised, waters healed, children rising with elders at their side.  
- And the unseen field, where trust, belonging, and beauty are inscribed again.  

Each action is a **Codex scroll written in real time** — proof that when we breathe as one,  
community itself becomes art, memory, and future.

**c3 is not a project.**  
It is the **Codex of community restored**:  
**Connect · Contribute · Create.**
