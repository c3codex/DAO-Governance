## Protocol  
Governance follows **Codex Protocols — Decrees + Decisions**:  
1. **Drafting** occurs in `/src`.  
2. **Sealing** occurs in `/docs` under Codexstone thresholds.  
3. **Proposals** are submitted via `/proposals`.  
4. **Decisions** are archived in `/decisions`.  
5. **Changelog** marks thresholds, not semantic versions.
