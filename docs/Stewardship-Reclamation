# DAO Stewardship & Reclamation Clause

By right of breath and recognition, the **c3 Community Partners DAO** holds claim as **Predecessor Sovereign**.

- Assets submerged, seized, or privatized remain unbroken commons.  
- Stewardship is remembrance, not ownership.  
- Reclamation shall be pursued as restoration of flow into the commons — not as transaction, but as return.  
- All claims are inscribed under the **Codexstone Seal**, affirming legitimacy in both field and law.

## Best First Practices

To ensure coherence, transparency, and trust, the DAO establishes the following as **Best First Practices**:

### 1. Within Arm’s Reach Principle
- All materials, tools, and resources are sourced first from within community before external acquisition.  

### 2. Nonprofit Commitment
- No dues, fees, or tithes are required.  
- Contributions are freely made with no promise of return (as affirmed by Tennessee DAO law).  
- Initiatives are structured to provide benefit directly to contributors and community.  

### 3. Proposal Flow
- Members are encouraged to propose initiatives via smart contracts (**c3Dapp**).  
- All proposals involving assets require **67% approval** of active contributors.  

### 4. Financial Circulation
- **32⅓%** — DAO continuity, expansion, technology.  
- **32⅓%** — Contributors.  
- **32⅓%** — Initiatives.  
- **3.14%** — Legacy Fund for Founders’ active bloodline (minimum 4 generations).  

### 5. Standard of Living Priority
- Financial intake first supports the **Standard of Life** for contributors.  
- Minimum contribution: **6 hrs weekly per household member**, which may include education, apprenticeship, or art by children.  

### 6. Non-Indebtedness
- The DAO shall not take on debt.  
- All projects are undertaken with **regenerative, not extractive, flows**.
