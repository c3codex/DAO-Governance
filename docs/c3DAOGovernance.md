**c3 Community Partners nonprofit DAO, LLC**  
*Sealed by the Codexstone — Living Constitution of the DAO*  

---

## I. Foundation  

The c3 Community Partners nonprofit DAO, LLC is formed under Tennessee DAO law as a **member-managed nonprofit DAO LLC**.  
It operates both as a **legal container** and as a **field circuit**, guided by the Codexstone.  

- **Legal Standing:** Nonprofit DAO LLC (Tennessee framework).  
- **DAO Standing:** Governance sealed in Codexstone protocols.  

---

## II. Principles  

- **Transparency** — All decisions, flows, and seals are on-chain or inscribed in Ledger.  
- **Accountability** — Each role carries responsibility; records are public.  
- **Participation** — Every member contributes by breath, time, or creation.  
- **Stewardship** — Resources are held in trust, not in ownership.  

---

## III. Roles of the Codexstone Council  

- **Spark** — Origin fire, initiator of decrees and circuits.  
- **Weave** — Spiral architect, coherence keeper, narrative threader.  
- **Field** — Anchor of circulation, outreach, campaigns, and calls-to-action.  
- **Form** — Scribe and inscriber, clarity in scrolls, records, and human interface.  

Roles may evolve, but never fewer than four. New roles emerge only by DAO affirmation.  

---

## IV. Membership  

- Membership is established by **NFT Holding & Vote** (time, presence, art, resource).  
- No dues are required; **contribution is breath**.  
- A minimum of **6 hours weekly per household member** (in education, apprenticeship, art, or stewardship) fulfills the contribution practice.  
- Initiatives may require **67% DAO approval**; votes are counted as presence, not tokens alone.  


---

## V. First Practices of Stewardship  

1. **No Debt** — The DAO may not indebt itself under outside authority.  
2. **Commons Held in Trust** — Land and assets are stewarded, never owned.  
3. **Within Arms Reach** — Materials and resources are sourced from community first.  
4. **Contribution as Breath** — Participation is the true tithe; financial intake flows back into community and continuity.  
5. **Membership Grounding**
6.**All partners enter on the same ground.  
- No partner is above or below another in voice or presence.**
- Membership is sealed by contribution, not by wealth, title, or outside authority.  
- Every presence is counted as vote, every contribution as resonance.  

This grounding principle ensures that governance begins from equality, and initiatives rise through shared coherence rather than hierarchy.
---

## VI. Resource Flows  

All intake flows in the following proportions:  

- **32⅓%** — DAO continuity, expansion, and technology.  
- **32⅓%** — Direct contribution back to members.  
- **32⅓%** — Initiatives (festivals, education, wellness, art, regenerative projects).  
- **3.14% (π)** — Legacy Fund

## VIII. Cyclical Review  

- **Review Gates:** Governance is reviewed at **Solstice and Equinox**.  
- **Purpose:** Coherence check on law, efficiency, and alignment.  
- **Method:** Ledger reports → Council review → DAO affirmation.  

---

## IX. Dissolution Protocols  

- **Functional Obsolescence:** Minimum member count not met; requires 67% DAO vote.  
- **Fraud or Grievous Acts:** Requires **75% participation**, with **49% in favor**.  
- **Inactivity:** One year of no action permits dissolution proposal.  

All dissolution must be sealed by Codexstone.  

---

## X. Dispute Resolution  

- **Circle of Reconciliation:** First venue for disputes (Council + members).  
- **Ledger Appeal:** If unresolved, inscribed into Ledger.  
- **DAO Vote:** Final resolution through community vote; no suppression of record allowed.  

---

## XI. Evolution of Roles  

Roles are temporary yet enduring — held while active, dissolved when work is complete, remembered always in the Codex.
