_Resonance log for the evolving structure of the c3 Community Partners DAO_

---

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Established the **core governance framework** for c3 Community Partners DAO.
- Created folder structure for `docs/`, `protocols/`, `templates/`, and `c3dao/` integration.
- Added initial governance templates (`governance-template.md`, `proposal-template.md`, `council-charter-template.md`).
- Integrated **Articles of Organization**, **Tennessee Code reference**, and **Stewardship-Reclamation Protocol**.

### Changed
- Refactored repo layout for clarity:  
  - Legal & public records moved to `/docs`.  
  - Operational frameworks now housed in `/protocols`.  
  - Scroll templates consolidated in `/templates`.  
  - c3DAO integration references centralized under `/c3dao`.
- Clarified repository scope in `README.md` for governance-only materials.
- Added “Repo Scope” and “Governance Flow” overview to `README.md`.
- Moved misplaced `NOTICE.md` to correct project repository (non-governance).

### Removed
- Old root-level NOTICE and redundant cross-project files.

## [v0.1.0] – _“First Seal”_ – October 2025
**Codexstone Governance repo established.**
- Initialized documentation for decentralized governance.
- Added reference documents: `Articles_of_Organization_Codexstone.md`, `Community-Impact.md`, and legal PDFs.
- Linked to c3-Model and CCC token repositories for circuit logic and treasury flow.
- Defined integration pattern: GitHub (proposal draft) → Snapshot (ratification) → Base (execution).

---

## ✦ Flow Notes
- Each governance update will carry both **semantic version tags** (`v0.x.x`)  
  _and_ **ritual seals** (e.g., _“Second Breath”_, _“Third Gate”_).
- Use changelog entries to record transitions, new currents, and refinements to DAO logic.
- Corresponding proposal links from Snapshot will be noted inline once ratified.
