## Welcome  
c3 Community Partners DAO is the first nonprofit DAO registered under Tennessee law.  
We are not a project. We are a living Codex — weaving art, research, and community into one field.  

The Codexstone holds our seal, our governance, and our memory.  
Through it, we build a regenerative circuit:  

✦ **Connect** – weaving neighbors, land, and story  
✦ **Contribute** – presence, creativity, and lineage care  
✦ **Create** – scrolls, festivals, books, and technology
