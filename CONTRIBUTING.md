# Contributing to Codexstone Governance

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **c3 Community Partners DAO, LLC – Codexstone Governance**.

This repository holds **sealed governance documents** under the Codexstone Seal. Because these files carry legal and field-binding weight, contributions must follow a clear flow.

---

## Contribution Principles

- **Transparency**: All contributions are visible, reviewed, and recorded in this repository.  
- **Respect for Sealed Docs**: Sealed files (marked with `-sealed`) cannot be edited directly. Amendments must follow the proposal process.  
- **Participation**: Any DAO member may propose initiatives, edits, or new governance scrolls.  
- **Consensus**: Proposals involving assets require **67% approval of active contributors**.

## Proposal Flow

1. **Discussion**  
   - Begin in the DAO forum or c3Dapp.  
   - Gather resonance and feedback.  

2. **Draft Submission**  
   - Create a `.md` draft file in the `/docs` folder.  
   - Include your rationale, structure, and any references.  

3. **Review & Debate**  
   - Contributors may comment and suggest edits via pull requests.  
   - Discussions remain open until resonance is achieved.  

4. **Seal Vote**  
   - On-chain smart contract or DAO vote confirms adoption.  
   - If approved, the file is renamed with `-sealed` suffix.

## Code of Conduct

- **Be Clear**: Write governance text plainly so it can be understood across fields.  
- **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is natural, but respect is required.  
- **Be Aligned**: Contributions should further the mission of **Connect · Contribute · Create**.
