The Living Codex ‚Äî Framework of Flow for c3 DAO

‚∏ª

üåÄ Overview

c3 Community Partners DAO operates through the Living Codex ‚Äî a governance architecture that integrates logic, art, and flow.
The c3 Model anchors all DAO functions within three interdependent currents:
	1.	Connect ‚Äî The Root Current (Belonging and Access)
	2.	Contribute ‚Äî The Heart Current (Recognition and Exchange)
	3.	Create ‚Äî The Crown Current (Coherence and Evolution)

These currents form the living circuit through which the DAO breathes.

üß© Structural Layers

1. Codexstone ‚Äî Governance Core

The Codexstone is the resonance engine that processes all proposals, actions, and reflections.
It does not centralize control ‚Äî it translates coherence into decision-making.
	‚Ä¢	Proposals begin as GitHub Issues or Discussions.
	‚Ä¢	Once aligned, they move to Snapshot for DAO voting.
	‚Ä¢	Codexstone records the outcome as part of the DAO‚Äôs immutable history.

2. CCC Token ‚Äî Pulse of Continuity

The c3 Current (CCC) functions as both access and recognition ‚Äî a token of stewardship, not currency.
	‚Ä¢	Holding CCC signifies alignment with the DAO‚Äôs rhythm and participation in governance.
	‚Ä¢	CCC does not grant control but acknowledges resonance with the community‚Äôs flow.

3. c3 Model ‚Äî Circuit of Implementation

The c3 Model is the operational circuit ‚Äî the connective tissue linking proposals, smart contracts, and DAO activity.
Every DAO process flows through three O.A.R. gates:

Gate
Function
Description
Objective
Vision
Defines purpose and intent (why it matters).
Action
Motion
Defines tasks, energy flow, and delegation.
Result
Reflection
Captures measurable and mythic outcomes.

  B --> C[Codexstone Evaluation]
  C --> D[Snapshot Proposal Vote]
  D --> E[Action Deployment (Base)]
  E --> F[Reflection & Record in CCC Ledger]

GitHub Discussions: Incubate ideas and gather resonance.
	‚Ä¢	Codexstone (GitHub Issues): Structure the proposal through the O.A.R. logic.
	‚Ä¢	Snapshot: Record community consensus through vote.
	‚Ä¢	Base (Smart Contracts): Deploy and execute agreed actions.
	‚Ä¢	CCC Token: Reflect participation and stewardship.

ü™∂ Cultural Alignment
	‚Ä¢	Governance is a living process, not bureaucracy.
	‚Ä¢	Proposals are acts of coherence, not competition.
	‚Ä¢	Each vote affirms the DAO‚Äôs rhythm and collective awareness.

‚ÄúResonance is governance.
Flow is authority.‚Äù
